					<article>
						<p>Hailing from Richmond Virginia, DJ RIFFA, aka Henri Charuau, is an up and coming DJ/Producer that brings a different approach to the scene. Having developed an extremely eclectic taste for sound, his style reflects many different genres and types of music. Throughout his years growing up, RIFFA played countless instruments and really developed a knack for getting things to sound a certain way. A combination of the music Henri has played and listens to have pushed him to never settle for anything not worth listening to..&nbsp;</p>
						<br>
						<p>Now, a resident DJ at KAI nightclub in Richmond, Henri has really been given a chance to hone in his talents as a DJ and push for success in the local nightlife scene. Recently, he has been seen playing at venues such as The National, Bellytimber Tavern, Balliceaux, The Lucky Buddha, and The Hat Factory. Playing in different venues has given RIFFA the ability to adapt to all different types of crowds and situations, giving him the necessary tools to succeed in any type of environment.&nbsp;</p>
